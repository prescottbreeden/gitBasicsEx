                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshpots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshotyou build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into your app.</p>
                <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                    <h4>Git init</h4>
                    <p>Git init is the act of registering this current code base.</p>
                </div>
                <div class=" block block-small">
                    <h4>Git add</h4>
                    <p>Git add is how we stage the integration of ourcurrent code base into our current list of snapshots</p>
                </div>
                <div class=" block block-small">
                    <h4>Git status</h4>
                    <p>Gitstatus allows us to see the changes we are going to make.</p>

                <div class=" block block-medium">
                    <h4>Git commit</h4>
                    <p>Git commit; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new shapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made</p>
                </div>
                <div class=" block block-medium">
                    <h4>Git remote add</h4>
                    <p>Gitremote add is used to set up an online repository where we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                <div class=" block block-large">
                    <h4>Git push</h4>
                    <p>Git push is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositrories. Other developers might look at our exisiting projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base wtih features they wanted to add.</p>
